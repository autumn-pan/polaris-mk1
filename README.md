# Polaris Mk. I Flight Computer

The Polaris Mk. I is a prototype flight computer built for educational purposes in amateur aerospace engineering. It was designed specifically for short rocket flights.

This computer comes with a BMP390 Barometer and a BMI088 IMU. This computer is capable of esimating its position, velocity and acceleration. While these estimates are prone to noise and drift, the included Kalman Filter tries to minimize that.

This flight computer has never flown before and was mainly created by me to learn more about avionics.
